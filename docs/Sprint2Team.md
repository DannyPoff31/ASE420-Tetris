### What Went Wrong:
- Lots of refactoring of old and new code in order to fit design principles
- Some new code needed to be separated better. Specifically in the renderer.
- Communication
- Managing complexity
---
### Analysis & Improvement Plan:
- Use of more concrete design diagrams
- Foresee and Prevent the early on creation of god objects
---
### What Went Well:
- Applied functional design patterns that worked well
- Due to our implementation of special blocks and gamemodes there is plenty of room for extension
- Gained experience with refactoring techniques and use of design patterns
